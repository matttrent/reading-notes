### Epigraph

No wonder they disagreed so endlessly; they were talking about different things.
—ROBERT L. HEILBRONER

### Prologue

I wanted to chronicle the important events of my time. Only after I began work did the obvious question occur: What are those important events

Most of all, the clash between Vogtians and Borlaugians is heated because it is less about facts than about values

To the philosopher-critic Lewis Mumford, all of these battles were part of a centuries-long struggle between two types of technology, “one authoritarian, the other democratic, the first system-centered, immensely powerful, but inherently unstable, the other man-centered, relatively weak, but resourceful and durable.” And all of them were about, at least in part, the relationship

of our species to Nature

### 1  State of the Species

Microorganisms have changed the face of the earth, crumbling stone and even giving rise to the oxygen we breathe. Compared to this power and diversity, Margulis liked to tell me, pandas and polar bears were epiphenomena—interesting and fun, perhaps, but not actually significant.

### 2  The Prophet

A thin but immeasurably rich skin on Earth, the soil was quite literally the foundation of the human enterprise

Environmentalism, by contrast, is a political and moral movement based on a set of beliefs about nature and the human place within it.

Until something has a name, it can’t be discussed or acted upon with intent. “People, by naming the world, transform it,” wrote the Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. Without “the environment,” there would be no environmental movement

### 3  The Wizard

But the two men drew different conclusions from the same picture; they disagreed about which elements were figure and which were ground. Vogt saw the land behind and beneath as the protagonist of the story—the origin of both problem and solution. With his ecologist’s eye, he viewed the fundamental issue as one of carrying capacity. People, biological agents like any other, had to fit in.
By contrast, Borlaug saw the farmers as the central characters. Their suffering was caused not by overshooting the capacity of the land but by their lack of tools and knowledge

A prerequisite for a successful scientific career is an enthusiastic willingness to pore through the minutiae of subjects that 99.9 percent of Earth’s population find screamingly dull

### 4  Earth: Food

the Haber-Bosch process, as it is called, was arguably the most consequential technological development of the twentieth century, and one of the more important human discoveries of any time. The Haber-Bosch process has literally changed the land and sky, reshaped the oceans, and powerfully affected the fortunes of humanity

He didn’t simply criticize the scientist who rarely ventured into fields, he called out this wretched specimen as a “laboratory hermit,” “all intent on learning more and more about less and less” in the bowels of an “obsolete research organization

At the beginning it might have been possible to reconcile the two points of view. One can imagine industrial advocates considering humus, humus advocates willing to use chemicals as a supplement to good soil practice. But that didn’t happen. Hurling insults, the two sides moved ever further apart

the strawberry plants and, later, the potato plants in another test. In effect, all were saying: We don’t trust you white-coats—there have been too many examples of unintended consequences.

Which of the two farms is more productive? Wizards and Prophets would disagree about the answer, because they disagree about the question

### 5  Water: Freshwater

his garden cities would use water efficiently, cheaply, and cleanly. They would have three parallel water systems: one for carrying potable water from nearby springs; a second for collecting stormwater and wastewater and pumping them with windmills into reservoirs for reuse by agriculture and public works; and a third for gathering sewage for recycling

The hard path asks: How can we get more water? Focused on increasing supply, first and foremost, it stems from the belief that the demand for clean freshwater is inexhaustible. Its logical outcome, according to Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute: “ever-larger numbers of dams, reservoirs, and aqueducts to capture, store, and move ever-larger fractions of freshwater runoff.”

The soft path, by contrast, is something new. Decentralization, efficiency, and education are its hallmarks. It “draws all ‘new’ water from better use of existing supplies and changing habits and attitudes

Private companies can better manufacture cars” than governments, Frérot told me, and water “is exactly the same.

Already farms use four-fifths of the state’s water. Greatly increasing agricultural productivity means increasing the supply, which in the long run means desalination

Meanwhile, more water is used to grow alfalfa than is consumed by all the households in California. And so on.

The dispute in California will be echoed in different ways across the globe. The hard path creates universal Wizardly solutions that do not depend on local conditions or knowledge. It leads quite naturally to broad fields of waving grain—visions of concentrated productivity. Societies that adopt the soft path will lead toward networks of smaller farms with drip irrigation and multiple crops—the inhabited, networked spaces preferred by Prophets. One values a kind of liberty; the other, a kind of community. One sees nature instrumentally, as a set of raw materials freely available for use; the other believes each ecosystem has an inner integrity and meaning that should be preserved, even if it constrains human actions. The choices lead to radically different pictures of how to live. What looks like a dispute over practical matters is an argument of the heart

### 6  Fire: Energy

Walking through the city’s ruins, I found it hard not to wonder whether our industrial era was not simply Pithole writ large: an evanescent surge of wealth, much of it squandered, doomed to end when the world’s fuel supply was consumed.

When plants die today, fungi decompose them, releasing their trapped solar energy. In the Carboniferous, most fungi apparently had not yet evolved the ability to break down lignin, the tough compound that gives plant stems their strength and bulk. Buried in almost oxygen-free sludge, attacked only slowly or not at all by fungi, the lepidodendrons, horsetails, and giant ferns decayed at an infinitesimal rate, creating layers of peat. Over the eons, crushed and heated by the slow churning of the earth, the peat became coal

With few exceptions, distributed sun and wind power gains viability only in situations where people consider the by-products of massive energy consumption

Because energy is critical to modern life, these utilities, as we now call them, became so politically important that many governments seized them as essential tools of the state; other nations contented themselves with heavy regulation. Either way, utilities have become a prominent feature of the contemporary landscape. Economically speaking, the advantages of Wizard-style, hard-path centralization and scale were so overwhelming that until recently efforts to promulgate Prophet-style distributed power systems almost vanished.

Should the fruit flies continue to multiply at their initial compound interest rate, it can be shown by computation that in a relatively few weeks the number would be considerably greater than the capacity of the bottle. This being so, it is a very simple matter to see why there is a definite limit to the number of fruit flies that can live in the bottle. Once the number is reached, the death rate is equal to the birth rate, and population growth ceases. Very little thought and examination of the facts should suffice to convince one that in the case of the production of coal, pig iron, or automobiles, circumstances are not essentially different.

It is commonly asked, when will the world’s supply of oil be exhausted?” wrote the MIT economist Morris Adelman. “The best one-word answer: never.” On its face, this seems ridiculous—how could a finite stock be inexhaustible, when a constantly renewed flow can run out? But more than a century of experience has shown it to be true. As a practical matter, we know only that there is more than enough for the foreseeable future

renewable-energy leaders see their goal as building giant, centralized facilities like Crescent Dunes—they are Borlaugians through and through, hard-path advocates in solar guise. But many or most renewable-energy supporters are Prophets who view Big Solar and Big Wind with almost as much distaste as the Big Coal and Big Oil they seek to replace

### 7  Air: Climate Change

It is a philosophical truism that exclusively caring about oneself is not a route to a happy or satisfying life

Rather than concluding from this history that, as Allitt put it, “environmental problems, though very real, were manageable,” each side stored up bitterness, like batteries taking on charge

Cutting emissions from these cars and homes means changing the daily lives of billions of people, a mind-boggling thought. Reducing global coal emissions, by contrast, means dealing with 3,300 big coal-fired power plants and several thousand big coal-driven steel and cement factories.*10 The task is huge, but it is at least imaginable—and it targets almost half of the world’s emissions at a stroke

### 8  The Prophet

Man’s command over nature has grown more rapidly than his mastery of himself

### 9  The Wizard

In private, he told friends that most of the criticism was sheer elitism. Somehow rich environmentalists in the West thought the world was better off if people in poor areas didn’t improve their lives. He had nothing against organic this or that but it was unrealistic to promote it as a solution to hunger in the world of 10 billion. And it was immoral to stand in the way of feeding hungry people.

The air in the scientific workshop is so clean and bracing and the results of researchers sequestering themselves inside so satisfying that they lose their bearings. They don’t want to leave the workshop. They prefer to live in its world of abstraction, separate as angels from the messiness of life. Or, worse, the findings of the workshop seem so luminous and clear, so like beacons of truth, they forget that the workshop is a special place within the world and begin to think that it is above the rest of life and should control it. And here, Husserl said, lies peril, because the people outside the workshop will come to detest and disbelieve the people within its privileged walls.

Like Vogt, Borlaug was caught up in the clash between the workshop and the world. Farmers in India and Mexico thought of their wheat in terms of how they experienced it—as a plant that was (or wasn’t) easy to grow and harvest, as grain that made flour with certain qualities, as the source of bread that, eaten daily, conveyed a statement about their lives, as a set of smells and tastes and colors, as a storehouse of memory and identity. Borlaug had taken this wheat into the workshop of science. There, in effect, he reduced wheat to a series of numbers: plant height, degree of rust resistance, spikelet number, flowering date, and so on. He measured these numbers in an effort to maximize another number: the weight of harvestable wheat. All of this was totally normal scientific procedure. And it worked—he created varieties of wheat that were resistant to multiple types of rust and yielded two or three times more grain.

But what was left out was the color of the bran, the texture of the grain, the pleasure of having several different types of flour, or, more important still, the relationship of the farmers to their land, and to each other, and the structure of power in a community or a nation. And then there was the omnipresence of greed. Borlaug was like a physicist who figures out how something should work on an idealized frictionless plane and then is startled when it doesn’t function in the same way in the real world of hills and valleys.
Scientists say that because the workshop has found that A is true the world should do B. But people in the world notice that when scientists go into the workshop they strip their objects of study of everything but a few measurable quantities, and then the people object that what was stripped away was worthy, even essential. They see the scientists unable to understand the resistance to following course B as condescending aliens who don’t share their values—and, all too often, they are correct. Why would you listen to people who have no idea what you consider important

### 10  The Edge of the Petri Dish

Consciously or not, the bishop was effectively asking whether Huxley was prepared to affirm that he and all other people were prisoners of biology. Blinded by contempt, Huxley seems not to have realized that his adversary was posing, however rudely, an important question. (The “great question,” the great conservationist George Perkins Marsh called it a few years later: “whether man is of nature or above her

There is no permanent victory condition for being human, as the writer Bruce Sterling has remarked

Wizards and Prophets both believe that Margulis is wrong—that Crusoe and the others would have gained enough knowledge to save themselves. They would have either used this knowledge to create technology to soar beyond natural constraints (as Wizards hope) or changed their survival strategy from expanding their presence to living in a steady-state accommodation with what the island offered (as Prophets wish).

### Appendix A: Why Believe? (Part One)

But Margulis thought that natural selection was just part of the picture—in the long run, symbiosis and chance were more important sources of evolutionary innovation. Maynard Smith thought Margulis was off base. “But I’ll grant her one thing,” he said, as I remember it. “She’s a remarkably good skeptic. Even if she’s wrong, she’s fruitfully wrong.”
