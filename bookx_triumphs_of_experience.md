# Triumphs of Experience

_Triumphs of Experience_ details the Grant Study, the most comprehensive longetivity study ever conducted, following 264 Harvard sophomores in 1938 all the way through their lives.

## maturation makes liars of us all

This is one important truth of adult development: people grapping with growing up in their own ways, but we all do have to grapple.

Everyone is consistent in some things and not in others, yet ultimately true to some fundamental essence of themselves.

## to flourish for the next 60 years

__The only thing that really matters in life are your relations to other people.__

Constructed a Decathalon of Flourishing scoring the quality of life between age 60 and 80, included recognition, income, health, good relationships, enjoyment.  They correlated against a number of variables including physical shape, activity, social class, and attachment/relations.

__Only physical activity and human relations had any correlation with high Decathalon of Flourishing scores.__

Correlated values:

- vital effect (rich exhuberant social presence) -- significant
- atheletic prowess -- very significant
- treadmill run -- significant
- good childhood temperment -- significant
- warm childhood -- very significant
- overall college soundness -- very significant
- empathic coping (defense) style -- very significant
- warm adult relations 30-45 -- very significant

The 58 men with the best scores for warm relationships had a maximum income of \$243,000 a year, while the 31 men with the worst scores in relationships earned an average maximum salary of \$102,000 a year.  The 12 men with the most mature coping styles reported a whopping \$369,000 a year; and the the most immature styles a much more modest \$159,000.  No difference between salaries of men with IQ of 110 vs IQ of 150+.

These same variables were equally able to predict warm relationships at the end of life.  

Nuture trumps nature -- at least for predicting late-life succes as the Decathalon embodied it.

__Understand that happiness is the cart; love is the horse.__

There are 2 pillars to happiness revealed by the study.  One is love.  The other is finding a way to cope with life that does not push love away.

6 Major Lessons:

1. Positive mental health does exist, and to some degree can be understood independent of moral and cultural biases.
2. An understanding of adaptive coping is crucial.  As in inflammation and fevers, what looks like trouble maybe be the very process by which healing takes place.
3. The most important influnce by far on a flourishing life is love.
4. People really can change and people can grow.  Childhood need be neither destiny nor doom.
5. It is the quality of a child's total experience, not any particular trauma or relationship, that exerts the clearest influence on adult development.  What goes right matter more than what goes wrong.
6. If you follow lives long enough, they change, and so do the factors that affect healthy adjustment.

The 75 years and $20 million expended on the Grant study point, at least to me, to a straightforward five-word conclusion: __"HAPPINESS IS LOVE. FULL STOP."__

## how childhood and adolescence affect old age

What goes right matter more than what goes wrong.

## maturation

The increased ability -- not uncommon as people get older -- to stay aware of uncomfortable feelings without having to control or disown them.

## marriage

## living to ninety

## resiliance and unconscious coping

## alcoholism
