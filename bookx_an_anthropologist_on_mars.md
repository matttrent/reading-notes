### The Case of the Colorblind Painter

Mr. I. commented that he now found himself in an inconstant world, a world whose lights and darks fluctuated with the wavelength of illumination, in striking contrast to the relative stability, the constancy, of the color world he had previously known.14

Goethe was centrally concerned with the way we actually see colors and light, the ways in which we create worlds, and illusions, in color. This, he felt, was not explicable by Newton’s physics, but only by some as-yet unknown rules of the brain. He was saying, in effect, “Visual illusion is neurological truth.

These demonstrations, overwhelming in their simplicity and impact, were color “illusions” in Goethe’s sense, but illusions that demonstrated a neurological truth—that colors are not “out there” in the world, nor (as classical theory held) an automatic correlate of wavelength, but, rather, are constructed by the brain.

### The Last Hippie

And whereas for the rest of us the present is given its meaning and depth by the past (hence it becomes the “remembered present,” in Gerald Edelman’s term), as well as being given potential and tension by the future, for Greg it was flat and (in its meager way) complete. This living-in-the-moment, which was so manifestly pathological, had been perceived in the temple as an achievement of higher consciousness.

### To See and Not See

We, with a full complement of senses, live in space and time; the blind live in a world of time alone. For the blind build their worlds from sequences of impressions (tactile, auditory, olfactory) and are not capable, as sighted people are, of a simultaneous visual perception, the making of an instantaneous visual scene. Indeed, if one can no longer see in space, then the idea of space becomes incomprehensible—even for highly intelligent people blinded relatively late in life

### The Landscape of His Dreams

Apparently the ‘flash’ Franco gets of a scene is not a static, photographic view.… He can scan the area and ‘see’ in several directions. To do this, he must physically reorient his body, turning to the right to envision what would be to the right in the Pontitan scene, to the left to ‘see’ to that side

It is precisely this characteristic that Proust holds to be the most valuable: to his mind, voluntary recall is conceptual, conventional, and flat—only involuntary recall, erupting or conjured from the depths, can convey the full quality of childhood experience, in all its innocence, wonder, and terror.

remembering of pictures, that convinced Frederic Bartlett, in the 1920s and 1930s, that there is no such entity as “memory,” but only the dynamic process of “remembering” (he is always at pains, in his great book Remembering, to avoid the noun and use the verb

### Prodigies

Whenever you go out to paint, try to forget what objects you have in front of you—a tree, a house, a field, or whatever.… Merely think, here is a little squeeze of blue, here an oblong of pink, here a streak of yellow, and paint it just as it looks to you, the exact color and shape, until it gives your own naive impression of the scene before you.

I sometimes wondered whether “emotion” or “emotional response” might be radically different in Stephen: no less intense, but somehow more localized than in the rest of us—object-bound, scene-bound, event-bound, without ever coalescing or extending into anything more general, without becoming a part of him. I sometimes felt that he picked up the mood or the atmosphere of places, people, scenes, by a sort of instant sympathy or mimicry, rather than through what would usually be called a sensibility

Stephen’s development has been singular, qualitatively different, from the start. He constructs the universe in a different way—and his mode of cognition, his identity, his artistic gifts, go together. We do not know, finally, how Stephen thinks, how he constructs the world, how he is able to draw and sing. But we do know that though he may be lacking in the symbolic, the abstract, he has a sort of genius for concrete or mimetic representations, whether drawing a cathedral, a canyon, a flower, or enacting a scene, a drama, a song—a sort of genius for catching the formal features, the structural logic, the style, the “thisness” (though not necessarily the “meaning”), of whatever he portrays.

### An Anthropologist on Mars

And her own mode of thinking allowed her no escape from these realities. “If you’re a visual thinker, it’s easier to identify with animals,” she said as we drove to the farm. “If all your thought processes are in language, how could you imagine that cattle think? But if you think in pictures
