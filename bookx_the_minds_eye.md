### A Man of Letters

This raises a deep problem: Why should all human beings have this built-in facility for reading, when writing is a relatively recent cultural invention?

We might call this the Wallace problem, for Alfred Russel Wallace (who discovered natural selection independently of Darwin) became intensely concerned with the paradox of the human brain’s many potential abilities—lexical, mathematical, and so on—abilities that would be of little use in a primitive or prehistoric society

Such a redeployment of neurons is facilitated by the fact that all (natural) writing systems seem to share certain topological features with the environment, features which our brains evolved to decode. Mark Changizi, Shinsuke Shimojo, and their colleagues at Caltech examined more than a hundred ancient and modern writing systems, including alphabetic systems and Chinese ideograms, from a computational point of view. They have shown that all of them, while geometrically very different, share certain basic topological similarities. (This visual signature is not evident in artificial writing systems, such as shorthand, which are designed to emphasize speed more than visual recognition.) Changizi et al. have found similar topological invariants in a range of natural settings, and this has led them to hypothesize that the shapes of letters “have been selected to resemble the conglomerations of contours found in natural scenes, thereby tapping into our already-existing object recognition mechanisms.”

### Face-Blind

The brain,” Flourens said, only half jesting, “secretes thought as the liver secretes bile.”

It is similar with many other capacities, from stereo vision to linguistic power: some predisposition or potential is built in genetically but requires stimulation, practice, environmental richness, and nourishment if it is to develop fully. Natural selection may bring about the initial predisposition, but experience and experiential selection are needed to bring our cognitive and perceptual capacities to their full realization

The brain is more than an assemblage of autonomous modules, each crucial for a specific mental function. Every one of these functionally specialized areas must interact with dozens or hundreds of others, their total integration creating something like a vastly complicated orchestra with thousands of instruments, an orchestra that conducts itself, with an ever-changing score and repertoire

### Stereo Sue

It was not just a quantitative increase; it was something entirely novel. Stereoscopy, she maintains, is subjectively different.14 This difference even extends to the perception of two-dimensional representations such as photographs, movies, or paintings. Sue now finds these far more “realistic”; her now-activated stereo systems allow her to imagine space in a way she could not before.

### Persistence of Vision: A Journal

And often it is a visual emptiness—a ceiling, a white washbasin, the sky—which makes me conscious of the visual patterns and images continually chasing across my visual field. Yet these little hallucinations are interesting, in a way: they show me the background activity, the idling, of my visual system, generating and transforming patterns, never at rest.

I wake every morning to a cluttered world, everything on top of everything else. There is no room anywhere, no space between things

Space was once a hospitable, deep realm in which I could locate myself and wander at will. I could enter it, I lived in it, I had a spatial relationship to everything I could see. That sort of space no longer exists for me visually—or mentally.

### The Mind’s Eye

in Mindsight, the philosopher Colin McGinn writes, “Images are not just minor variations on perception and thought, of negligible theoretical interest; they are a robust mental category in need of independent investigation.… Mental images … should be added as a third great category … to the twin pillars of perception and cognition.”

Seeing” occurred particularly when the subjects were able to move the camera voluntarily, pointing it here or there, looking with it. Looking was crucial, for there is no perception without action, no seeing without looking.
