# 4 Hour Workweek

## rules that change rules

sports evolve when sacred cows are killed, when basic assumptions are tested
same goes for life and lifestyles

if everyone is defining or solving a problem one way and the results are subpar, this is the time to ask, What if I did the opposite?

Alternating periods of activity and rest is necessary to survive, let alone thrive. Capacity, interest, and mental endurance wax and wane. Plan accordingly.

Personally, I aim for one month of overseas relocation or high intensity learning (martial arts, tango, whatever) for every 2 months of work projects.

Few people are willing to measure the results of their actions.

It is far more fun and productive to leverage your strengths than fix the holes in your armor

Eustress - stress that motivates or strengthens us

## dodging bullets

Pure hell forces action, but anything less than that can be endured within clever enough rationalization

What we fear doing the most is usually what we most need to do

A persons success in life can usually be measure by the number of uncomfortable conversations hes willing to have

Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear

__Questions__

1. define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you were considering.
1. what steps could you take to repair the damage or get things on the upswing, even if temporarily?
1. what outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable scenarios?
1. If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control?
1. what are you putting off out of fear?
1. what is it costing you -- financially, emotionally, physically -- to postpone action?
1. what are you waiting for?

## system reset

Unreasonable and unrealistic goals are easier to achieve
- less competition
- adrenalin rush

Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it precisely what you should strive to chase

Ask yourself "what would excite me?"

The goal wasn't specific enough. I hadn't defined alternative activities that I would be doing.

Have concrete goals
Make them unrealistic
Focus on activities to fill the space when work is removed

Contact people
- find personal email
- send 2-3 paragraph email showing familiarity with their work
- ask one thought-provoking question related to work/life philosophy
- start a dialogue so they reply to emails
- only ask for help after 3-4 exchanges

Get in touch with someone that knows the answer
Don't spend too much time with books or online that can lead to paralysis by analysis
_if encountering that situation, walk away, trust gut instinct_

Accomplish one action (most important) of the day before 11am

Schedule a commitment -- use guilt to your advantages

__Questions__

1. What would you do if there were no way you could fail?  If you were 10 times smarter than the rest of the world?
    - Create 6- and 12-month timelines
    - 5 having
    - 5 being
    - 5 doing
1. Drawing a blank?
    - What would you do with $100 million in the bank?
    - What would make you the most excited to wake up in morning?
    - One place to visit
    - One memory of a lifetime
    - One thing to do daily
    - One thing to do weekly
    - One thing you always wanted to learn
1. What does "being" entail doing?
1. What are the four dreams that would change it all?
1. Determine the cost of these dreams and calculate your targeted monthly income for both timelines?
1. Determine _three steps_ for each of the _four dreams_ in just the 6-month timeline and take the first step __now__.

## the end of time management

Doing something unimportant does not make it important
Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important
what you do is infinitely more important than how you do it

Pareto's law:  
20% of the causes produce 80% of the effects

Which 20% of the sources are causing 80% of my problems or unhappiness? 
Which 20% of the sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?

The emotional consequences of dealing with shitty people rarely justifies the gain, financial or otherwise.

Being busy is a form of laziness -- lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.

Parkinson's law:
A task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity to fill the time allotted for its completion.

Increase productivity through combining:

- limit tasks to the important to shorten the work time (80/20)
- limit the work time to limit tasks to the important (parkinson's law)

__Questions__

- Define a to-do list (20% with 80% of the gains)
- Define a stop-doing list (20% with 80% of the downsides)

1. If you had to only work 2 hours per day, what would you do?
1. If you had to work two hours _per week_, what would you do?
1. If you had a gun to your head and had to stop doing 4/5 of different time-consuming activities, what would you remove?
1. What are the 3 activities that I use to fill time to feel as though I've been productive?  
    Often used to postpone important actions that are uncomfortable due to chance
    of failure or rejection.
1. Who are the 20% of people who produce 80% of my enjoyment?  Which 20% causes 80% of your depression, anger and second-guessing?
1. Learn to ask "If this is the only thing I accomplish today, while I be satisfied with my day?"
1. At least 3 times a day ask "Are you inventing things to avoid the important?"
1. Do not multitask
1. Use Parkinson's law on a macro and micro level

There should never be more than 2 mission critical items to complete in a day.  
Do one in the first 2 hours of being up

## low information diet

Most information is negative, irrelevant to your goals, time consuming, and outside your influence.

__Questions__

1. Go on a 1-week media fast
1. Ask yourself "Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important?"
1. Practice the art of non-finishing

Don't learn things "just in case"

## interrupting interruption and the art of refusal

what could I convert to batch activities?

- email: mondays at 10am
- phone: completely eliminated
- laundry: every other sunday at 10pm
- credit cards/bills: every other monday after email
- strength training: every 4th day
