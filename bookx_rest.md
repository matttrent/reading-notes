HIS IS A BOOK about work. It is also, of course, a book about rest. This sounds paradoxical, but it illustrates the book’s central idea.

As a result, we see work and rest as binaries. Even more problematic, we think of rest as simply the absence of work, not as something that stands on its own or has its own qualities

First, work and rest are partners.

Second, rest is active.

Third, rest is a skill.

Finally, deliberate rest stimulates and sustains creativity.

No longer could scientists afford to “concentrate for extended periods of time on one subject” or think deeply “in the silence of the study, confident that rivals would not disrupt their tranquil meditations

Choosing to be prolific, he contended, meant closing off the possibility of doing great work.

Advice for a Young Investigator

Knowledge (and the culture that formed through the accumulation of knowledge) required the marriage of logical and discursive methods (ratio) and contemplative practices and attitudes (intellectus). Intellectus, in turn, was enabled by leisure, which Pieper described as not just a “result of spare time” but “an attitude of non-activity, of inward calm

Knowledge wasn’t just the product of work; how hard you worked to produce it became a measure of how significant and profound the knowledge was

Anything created through contemplation (or religious revelation, or intuition) was, by definition, less impressive and trustworthy.

The whole field of intellectual activity [has been] overwhelmed by the modern ideal of work and is at the mercy of its totalitarian claims,” he wrote, while space for contemplation and leisure had been eliminated in the name of “planned diligence and ‘total labor

Such designs assume that new ideas emerge from a stochastic process of people and ideas bouncing off each other, from brainstorms and chance encounters, rather than from contemplation or deep thinking.

Major discoveries require a “vigorous concentration of mental energy” to “raise to the conscious level” connections between observations made in the laboratory and “ideas slumbering in the unconscious

One must avoid distractions like “malicious gossip” and newspapers, the “intellectual dispersion and waste of time required by social activity

In other words, it is not constant effort that delivers results but a kind of constant, patient, unhurried focus that organizes the investigator’s attention when at work and is present but watchful during periods of ease

the better-developed your DMN, other scientists have found, the better able you are to construct models of other people’s minds.

slightly, while the resting group actually dropped a bit. The jokers in the pack were the undemanding task group: they were 40 percent more creative the second time and outperformed everybody else by a wide margin. Having to do the simple task didn’t wreck their creativity; on the contrary, because it gave them the chance to do a little mind-wandering, members of the fourth group had time to subconsciously work on the AUT.

The generative and evaluative functions are thought to take place in different parts of the brain, both of which are part of the DMN. In this theory one would expect that in creative people, the generative function would have more freedom to produce ideas, and the evaluative function would be less tightly integrated into the DMN.

The first stage, preparation, consists of all the visible, conscious activity necessary in modern creative and productive work

most creative breakthroughs happen when you’re immersed in a problem, familiar with all its parts, and examining it from every angle

So the preparation phase is absolutely necessary in creative thinking. Sometimes that works, but with big problems, often you hit a wall

To get past a mental block, whether you’re working with brainteasers or brain science, you have to move on to the next stage in Wallas’s model: incubation

At some point, though, the answer will feel within reach. At this point, Wallas warns, it is important not to force it, as returning your attention to the problem “may have the effect of interrupting or hindering it.” Instead, you have to trust that your unconscious will drive to the third phase, illumination, the moment when the answer bursts into your consciousness

exertion, like an inspiration,” as German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz said. From there, it is on to the verification phase: you set the solution on a logical foundation, fill in the details, or fit it into a bigger project

Despite their elusive and evasive properties, might it be possible that we can treat incubation and illumination as skills and discover ways to make them more dependable

skills every day. That’s why they develop and refine daily routines and practices that preserve time for mind-wandering, sharpen their sensitivity to insights, and allow them to capture moments of illumination

We must take advantage of all lucid moments, whether they occur during the meditation following prolonged rest; during the super-intense mental work nerve cells achieve when fired by concentration; or during scientific discussion, whose impact often generates unanticipated intuition like sparks from steel

WHEN YOU EXAMINE the lives of history’s most creative figures, you are immediately confronted with a paradox: they organize their lives around their work, but not their days

Their creativity and productivity, in other words, were not the result of endless hours of toil. Their towering creative achievements result from modest “working” hours.

So despite their differences in personality and the different quality of their achievements, both Darwin and Lubbock managed something that seems increasingly alien today. Their lives were full and memorable, their work was prodigious, and yet their days are also filled with downtime.

If you assume that the most productive office and home workers in this study are the same, this cohort is working between twenty-five and thirty-eight hours a week. In a six-day week, that works out to an average of four to six hours a day.

Deliberate practice,” they observed, “is an effortful activity that can be sustained only for a limited time each day.” Practice too little and you never become world-class. Practice too much, though, and you increase the odds of being struck down by injury, draining yourself mentally, or burning out

This upper limit, Ericsson concluded, is defined “not by available time, but by available [mental and physical] resources for effortful practice

The top performers actually slept about an hour a day more than the average performers. They didn’t sleep late. They got more sleep because they napped during the day. Of course there was lots of variability, but the best students generally followed a pattern of practicing hardest and longest in the morning, taking a nap in the afternoon, and then having a second practice in the late afternoon or evening

The best performers devoted more energy to organizing their time, thinking about how they would spend their time, and assessing what they did

In other words, the top students were applying some of the habits of deliberate practice—mindfulness, an ability to observe their own performance, a sense that their time was valuable and needed to be spent wisely—to their downtime

My morning is all about stilling the outside world so my mind can soar

They start work earlier, sometimes before dawn, even if they’re night owls rather than early risers. They concentrate on their most challenging work first, when their creative energy is likely to be at its peak. They believe in inspiration but don’t wait for it; instead, they find that work creates the conditions for inspiration. And they discover that rest improves rather than inhibits their creativity and can make them more productive, not less

Arnold Sommerfeld, a mathematician and theoretical physicist who trained some of the twentieth century’s greatest physicists, insisted that serious science required an early morning start

ago. As a student I burned lots of midnight oil, but once I had a job and children, I struggled to muster the energy to write at night. So I tried getting up before dawn and writing before anyone else in the house was up. To my surprise, not only did I have more time to write, the words came more easily: I was less prone to self-distraction and had just enough energy and awareness to write

Hans Selye’s early morning office, for example, was a space that surrounded him with “helpful” distractions like journal articles, books, and notes and insulated him from the “misleading” distractors of students and administrative duties

It is too easy, when rather tired, to fritter a whole day away with the intention of working but never getting properly down to it,” Littlewood said. “This is pure waste, nothing is done, and you have had no rest or relaxation.” Virtually every prolific author and scientist would agree. A day that starts with work creates rest that can be enjoyed without guilt. When you start early, the rest you take is the rest you’ve earned.

CREATIVE PEOPLE WHO discover deliberate rest don’t just spend a few focused hours each day working or prefer to concentrate their effort in the morning. They work the same hours of the day, every day, often seven days a week. Stephen King exemplifies the attitude that routine is critical to creative production

The reason it’s necessary to start writing, and to keep writing, is that creativity doesn’t drive the work; the work drives creativity. A routine creates a landing place for the muse

Professional chefs and line cooks, for example, put lots of energy into assembling their mise-en-place, the implements, ingredients, spices and sauces they’ll need during their shift. Like a hiker’s pack or a doctor’s surgical tray, the mise-en-place should have everything a cook needs to deal with any situation, organized for effortless retrieval. Indeed, chefs describe the mise-en-place as both a physical organization and a state of mind, and teach that the one supports the other: having all tools and ingredients in exactly the right place lets chefs get into that state of flow that permits them to work quickly and at a high level

It’s expressed in the phrase solvitur ambulando (“it is solved by walking”), variously attributed to the Greek philosopher Diogenes

My mind often comes to a standstill after some hours indoors,” he said, but on a walk “my mind immediately begins to move freely and instinctively over my subject. Ideas come rushing to my mind, without being called

The sudden and unexpected nature of the insights make for dramatic stories, but a closer look reveals that all of these examples follow Wallas’s model of preparation, incubation, and illumination

Indeed, many studies show that walking has a detrimental effect on tasks that require focused thinking and attention to detail. “It’s not that we should all get treadmill desks and get on them all the time,” Oppezzo says, “because it turns out it’s probably only good for a couple types of thinking.”

napping for an hour or more during the day—a nap long enough to allow one to dream—improves performance on memory and perceptual tasks

chronic fatigue or mental exhaustion decreases a person’s self-control and decision-making ability, making them more likely to impulsively cheat than their better-rested colleagues

she found that timing your nap can affect the balance of light sleep, REM sleep, and slow-wave sleep, and shape the kinds of benefits you get from it.

WHILE LOTS OF active and creative people have discovered that naps help them recharge, a few use naps to generate insights

It is precisely during this sleep,” he says, “that you will secretly, in the very depths of your spirit, solve most of its subtle and complicated technical problems, which in your state of waking consciousness you would never be humanly capable of solving

these moments between consciousness and sleep the hypnagogic sleep state (from the Greek hupnos, “sleep,” and agōgos, “leading to”). It’s like REM sleep, Montreal psychologist Michelle Carr explains: REM sleep and hypnagogia are both states in which “the mind is fluid and hyperassociative” and can more easily “bring together distant ideas in a new way

For all three, hypnagogic imagery appears after a period of preparation, as Graham Wallas described

Naps are powerful tools for recovering our energy and focus. We can even learn to tailor them to give us more of a creative boost, or provide more physical benefit, or explore the ideas that emerge at the boundary between consciousness and sleep

COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT EFFECTIVE form of deliberate rest is to stop working at just the right point: to see your next move, but leave it until tomorrow

mathematician John Littlewood noted that while “the natural impulse towards the end of a day’s work is to finish the immediate job,” it was preferable to “try to end in the middle of something,” since it was always easier to start the morning by going over “the latter part of the previous day’s work

Many writers start their careers believing that the best work is done in bursts of inspiration only to discover that they do higher-quality work and get more done if they pace themselves

For Stephenson, McPhee, and Murakami, getting deeply immersed for long periods in their work is not a problem; the challenge is to turn that potentially destructive force into a sustainable source of creative energy

The experiment showed that having “a break during which one works on a completely different task is more beneficial for idea production than working on a similar task or generating ideas continuously

Not only that, a sleep deficit of less than an hour a night led to declines greater than those seen in comparable groups tested in a sleep lab. This suggests that laboratory studies might be underestimating the impact of sleep loss and that in the real world, the added stresses of making decisions, picking up kids, and trying to lead a normal life amplify the effects of sleep loss

at the end of the day, theoretical physicist Hans Bethe would talk with collaborators about the next day’s work as a way of priming his sleeping mind. Linus Pauling made the practice of “thinking about certain scientific problems as [he] lay in bed, waiting to go to sleep” part of his problem-solving process. It might take weeks or months, but eventually the solution “would burst into [his] consciousness

This kind of break from work—the kind that allows what sociologists call detachment, the ability to put work completely out of your mind and attend to other things—turns out to be tremendously important as a source of mental and physical recovery from work.

emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of accomplishment (the three major symptoms of burnout)

For writers, scientists, and entrepreneurs, delaying vacations can also mean passing up opportunities for creative breakthroughs

Sonnentag and her colleagues argue that there are four major factors that contribute to recovery: relaxation, control, mastery experiences, and mental detachment from work

Relaxation is the most straightforward of the four to understand: it’s an activity that’s pleasant and undemanding

Control and mastery experiences are more interesting. In the context of recovery, control means having the power to decide how you spend your time, energy, and attention

Mastery experiences are engaging, interesting things that you do well. They’re often challenging, but this makes them mentally absorbing and all the more rewarding when you do them well. (These don’t just make your vacation better

For people working in highly uncertain jobs, having mastery experiences during breaks can be especially important

So detachment—the ability to feel disconnected from the job—turns out to be important in determining how much you recover during breaks. This turns out to be as true for evenings and weekends as long vacations

These results further undermine the idea that our mental energies refill with time, rather than through activities that promote recovery

Rather than treating vacations as big, annual events that are completely separate from our working lives, taking shorter but more frequent vacations every few months provides greater levels of recovery

We live in an era when we’re urged to be passionate about our work, to regard the boundary between work and life as an obsolete relic of the industrial age

The best scientists showed “an unusual urge to experiment athletically as well as scientifically” and selected “athletic activities that could be carried from youth into old age

Running seems to be particularly effective in stimulating neurogenesis

Physical stamina is also as important for creative work as for manual labor. We often underestimate how physically demanding cognitive tasks can be, especially ones that require focus for hours at a time, but as novelist Haruki Murakami puts it, “finishing an entire book is closer to manual labor” and “requires far more energy, over a long period, than most people ever imagine.” He

When we think of work and rest as opposites, or treat exercise as something that would be good to do when we finally have the time, we risk becoming like the low achievers in Eiduson’s group. Exercise helped Eiduson’s stars, and many other high-achieving communities, have long productive lives. We shouldn’t be surprised that people manage to be physically active and do world-class work. We should recognize that they do world-class work because they are physically active.

It’s not like restoring a ’57 Chevy,” which has an ideal, original state, he says; it’s more like “an endless canvas that you can keep changing and working on.”

Under the right conditions, hobbies and physical activities become what anthropologists and psychologists call “deep play,” activities that are rewarding on their own, but take on additional layers of meaning and personal significance. Play is one of the most important things we do

Because play is voluntary, intrinsically rewarding, mentally and physically engaging, and imaginative, it’s often absorbing and effortless; even when it’s physically challenging or uncomfortable, it’s not difficult in the same way a hard day at work is.

The term deep play was popularized by anthropologist Clifford Geertz, in a now-classic article about the deep meaning of Balinese cockfighting

First, deep play is mentally absorbing. It offers the player challenges to face and problems to solve

Second, deep play offers players a new context in which to use some of the same skills that they use in their work

Third, deep play offers some of the same satisfaction as work, but it also offers different, clearer rewards thanks to differences in media or scale or pace

Finally, deep play provides a living connection to the player’s past.

the appeal of the art in a small book helpfully titled Painting as a Pastime. Busy people need to cultivate forms of rest, he began, but are temperamentally unable to simply do nothing. “It is not enough merely to switch off the lights which play upon the main and ordinary field of interest,” he argued. “A new field of interest must be illuminated.” Fortunately, “the tired parts of the mind can be rested and strengthened, not merely by rest, but by using other parts.”

For creative and prolific people, seeing outside activities as expressions of the same interests that guide their professional lives builds a bridge between the worlds of work and rest and helps turn these activities into deep play. For Michelson and other creative figures, deep play didn’t compete with work; it was a way to express the same fascination with nature, need to challenge one’s self, and passion for focus and concentration and problem-solving

The ability to see rest and recreation as connected, even as part of a unified whole, was something that Bernice Eiduson and her successors observed in top-performing scientists

Low achievers, in contrast, said nothing about serious hobbies. They “had none or found them irrelevant to their work.” Rather than discover the benefits of deep play, the less-accomplished members of Eiduson’s cohort assumed that they would do better work by doing more work—and their careers suffered for it.

When he was CEO and chairman of Microsoft, Gates’s week away from the office—as well as from family and friends (from everyone, in fact, save an unobtrusive cook and caretaker)—took place in a small waterfront cottage with a view of the Olympic Mountains, in western Washington

The peacetime army lacked what historian Josiah Bunting III calls a “culture of what we may call ‘visible busyness,’” and they took advantage of this slower pace to give themselves “leisure to think, to ponder, to write.”

Wallas would labor on the project for more than two years, but The Art of Thought took shape during that trip.

ONE COMMON FEATURE of the travels and sabbaticals of Sagmeister, Engelbart, Penfield, Lovelock, and Wallas is that they mix alien and familiar elements. Sagmeister consciously sought out new locations that could provide stimulation and renewal

They found that bicultural engineers were promoted faster and had better reputations among their bosses and peers. In an industry that prizes the ability to be innovative, to get inside the minds of your customers, and to spot new opportunities, biculturalism made a measurable difference in who got ahead

Breadth and cultural distance gave designers a creative boost early on, but in the long run, depth—how long they spent living abroad—was most important

However, even a short period working abroad was better than nothing: the worst thing a creative designer could do was play it safe and stay home

The most fruitful sabbaticals, like other forms of deliberate rest, are active

Finally, while we usually think of sabbaticals as long (perhaps prohibitively so), they don’t have to be

Yet a weeklong sabbatical can be restorative when done skillfully, and even a monthlong sabbatical can be life-changing.

Rest doesn’t just magically appear when we need it, especially in today’s busy world. Taking rest seriously requires recognizing its importance, claiming our right to rest, and carving out and defending space for rest in our daily lives. We have to choose to make an earlier start to the day to earn time to rest later; we have to reserve space on the daily calendar for a walk, or keep time free on the weekends for a hobby or sport; we must arrange our finances and business affairs so we can take a sabbatical.

Protecting time for rest also forces you to consider whether a new opportunity, request for a favor, or demand on your time is really worth it.

So deliberate rest helps organize your life. It also helps calm your life

Today’s workplace moves us backward, and weakens our spirit. It is a mistake to assume that the most frazzled and panicked workers are the most serious. As William James wrote in “The Gospel of Relaxation,” “eagerness, breathlessness, and anxiety are not signs of strength: they are signs of weakness and of bad coordination.”

One of the more remarkable findings in the Eiduson study is that the most successful scientists saw their work and leisure as connected and mutually supportive, and expressed fewer anxieties about time pressure. For the top performers, swimming or hiking didn’t compete with their time in their laboratory, and they didn’t feel that the time they spent on deliberate rest was stolen from more productive things. They were careful not to spend too much time outdoors or pursuing hobbies, but for them, work and rest were all part of a whole.

Indeed, world-class performers often are more likely to call themselves “lazy” than their less-accomplished peers. This isn’t just false modesty. Because they seek out forms of rest that give their conscious minds a break and provide a mental and psychological boost but leave their subconscious minds free to run through ideas, test and reject possibilities, and home in on a solution, their sense of how much time they work and how much time they have at their disposal differs from that of their less-successful colleagues

William Osler, warned that without care, “good men are ruined by success in practice,” and that “ever-increasing demands” can leave even the most curious person “worn out, yet not able to rest.” It was essential to develop “some intellectual pastime which may serve to keep you in touch with the world of art, of science, or of letters.”

But when I tallied up the ages of the figures I discuss here, I was surprised to find that many of them lived well into their eighties and were active almost until the end

In his essay on recreation published in his 1895 book The Use of Life, John Lubbock makes a distinction between idleness and leisure: “Leisure is one of the grandest blessings, idleness one of the greatest curses,” he argues, and “one is the source of happiness, the other of misery.” Rest, he argues, is often mistaken for idleness, but it is not.
