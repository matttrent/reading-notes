# How to Live on 24 Hours a Day

Time is a great deal more than money.

You wake up in the morning and lo! your purse is magically full with twenty-four hours of the unmanufactured tissue of the universe of your life!  It is yours.  It is the most precious of possessions.

You have to live on this twenty-four hours of daily time.  Out of it you have to spin health, pleasure, money, content, respect, and the evolution of your immortal soul.

Which of us is free from that uneasy feeling that the "great spending departments" of his daily life are not managed as they ought to be?  Our excuse to ourselves is that there are only twenty-four hours in the day.  Yet, if we suceed in [all our tasks], as we sometimes do, we are not satisfied; the skeleton is still with us.

The most important preliminary to the task of arranging one's life so that one may live fully and comfortably within one's daily budget of twenty-four hours is the calm realization of the extreme difficulty of the task.

If you are not prepared for the discouragements and disillusions; if you will not be content with a small result for a big effort, then do not begin.  Beward of undertaking too much at the start.  Be content with quite a little.  Allow for accidents.

The chief beauty about the constant supply of time is that you cannot waste it in advance.

Yet in spite of all this he persists in looking upon those hours from ten to six as "the day".  Even if he does not waste [the remaining hours], he regards them simply as margin.

If my typical man wishes to live fully and completely he must, in his mind, arrange a day within the day.  It is a day of sixteen hours, and during all these hours he has nothing to do but cultivate his body his soul and his fellow men.

Six hours, probably more, have gone since you left the office--gone like a dream, gone like magic, unaccountably gone!

But I do suggest that you might, for a commencement, employ and hour and a half every other evening in some important and consecutive cultivation of the mind.

Confine your formal program (super-program, I mean) to six days a week.  Take the rest as sabbath unless you are inspired to do otherwise.  Half an hour at least on six mornings of the week, and one hour and a half on three evenings a week.  Allow much more than an hour and a half to do the work of an hour and a half.

I do not care what you concentrate on as long as you concentrate.  It is the mere disciplining of the thinking machine that counts.  But still, you may as well kill two birds with one stone, and concentrate on something useful.  I suggest a little chapter of Marcus Aurelius or Epictetus.  Or meditate.

It is the study of one's self.  Man, know thyself.  But reading books with not take the place of a daily, honest examination of what one has recently done, and what one is about to do.

The study of cause and effect, while it lessens the painfulness of life, adds to life's picturesqueness.

2 pieces of advice

1. Define the direction and scope of your efforts.  Choose a limited period or a limited subject.
1. Think as well as read.

Unless you have given at least 45 minutes to careful, fatiguing reflection (it is an awful bore at first) upon what you are reading, your 90 minutes of a night are chiefly wasted.

One danger is the developing a policy of rush, of being gradually more and more obsessed by what one has to do next.  In choosing the first occupations of those evening hours, be guided by nothing whatever but your taste and natural inclination.
