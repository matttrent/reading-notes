It was, as his son Francis wrote, “as though he were charged with theorising power ready to flow into any channel on the slightest disturbance, so that no fact, however small, could avoid releasing a stream of theory.” And the flow went both ways; Darwin himself often said that “no one could be a good observer unless he was an active theoriser.”

no one else has perceived that my chief interest in my orchid book, has been that it was a ‘flank movement’ on the enemy.” Darwin was never belligerent, like his “bulldog” Huxley, but he knew that there was a battle to wage, and he was not averse to military metaphors.

Natural beauty, for Darwin, was not just aesthetic; it always reflected function and adaptation at work. Orchids were not just ornamental, to be displayed in a garden or a bouquet; they were wonderful contrivances, examples of nature’s imagination, natural selection, at work

One level of brain activity may be working automatically, while another, the conscious level, is fashioning a perception of time, a perception which is elastic and can be compressed or expanded.

Christof Koch, a neuroscientist, distinguishes between “behavior” and “experience” and proposes that “behavior may be executed in a smooth fashion, while experience may be structured in discrete intervals, as in a movie

The dazzling performances of chess masters, lightning-speed calculators, musical improvisers, and other virtuosos may have less to do with basic neural speed than with the vast range of knowledge, memorized patterns and strategies, and hugely sophisticated skills they can call upon.

It is curious and intriguing that even with figures like Freud, who published so much, the most suggestive and prescient ideas may appear only in the course of their private letters and journals

Remembering is not the re-excitation of innumerable fixed, lifeless and fragmentary traces. It is an imaginative reconstruction, or construction, built out of the relation of our attitude towards a whole active mass of organized past reactions or experience, and to a little outstanding detail which commonly appears in image or in language form. It is thus hardly ever really exact, even in the most rudimentary cases of rote recapitulation, and it is not at all important that it should be so.

Gerald Edelman—drawing on the data of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, of embryology and evolutionary biology, of clinical and experimental work, and of synthetic neural modeling—proposes a detailed neurobiological model of the mind in which the brain’s central role is precisely that of constructing categories—first perceptual, then conceptual—and of an ascending process, a “bootstrapping,” where through repeating recategorization at higher and higher levels, consciousness is finally achieved. Thus, for Edelman, every perception is a creation and every memory a re-creation or recategorization.

The inseparability of memory and motive, Freud pointed out, opened the possibility of understanding certain illusions of memory based on intentionality: the illusion that one has written to a person, for instance, when one has not but intended to, or that one has run the bath when one has merely intended to do so. We do not have such illusions unless there has been a preceding intention.

I accepted that I must have forgotten or lost a great deal but assumed that the memories I did have—especially those which were very vivid, concrete, and circumstantial—were essentially valid and reliable, and it was a shock to me when I found that some of them were not.

It is startling to realize, though, that some of our most cherished memories may never have happened—or may have happened to someone else.

I suspect that such forgettings occur for everyone, and they may be especially common in those who write or paint or compose, for creativity may require such forgettings, in order that one’s memories and ideas can be born again and seen in new contexts and perspectives.

Once such a story or memory is constructed, accompanied by vivid sensory imagery and strong emotion, there may be no inner, psychological way of distinguishing true from false, nor any outer, neurological way

Our only truth is narrative truth, the stories we tell each other and ourselves—the stories we continually recategorize and refine. Such subjectivity is built into the very nature of memory and follows from its basis and mechanisms in the brains we have

What is extraordinary, first, is that they present themselves as clearly articulated words or phrases, not as jumbles of sound. One mishears rather than just fails to hear

What is especially striking about Sontag’s account (and similar accounts of proto-creativity) is the energy, the ravenous passion, the enthusiasm, the love with which the young mind turns to whatever will nourish it, seeks intellectual or other models, and hones its skills by imitation.

Sontag’s prodigious and precocious intelligence and creativity allowed her to leapfrog into “real” writing as a teenager, but for most people the period of imitation and apprenticeship, studenthood, lasts much longer. It is a time when one struggles to find one’s own powers, one’s own voice. It is a time of practice, repetition, of mastering and perfecting skills and techniques

Pope took this to mean that he should first gain a mastery of poetic forms and techniques. To this end, in his “Imitations of English Poets,” Pope began by imitating Walsh, then Cowley, the Earl of Rochester, and more major figures like Chaucer and Spenser, as well as writing “Paraphrases,” as he called them, of Latin poets. By seventeen, he had mastered the heroic couplet and began to write his “Pastorals” and other poems, where he developed and honed his own style but contented himself with the most insipid or clichéd themes. It was only once he had established full mastery of his style and form that he started to charge it with the exquisite and sometimes terrifying products of his own imagination. For most artists, perhaps, these stages or processes overlap a good deal, but imitation and mastery of form or skills must come before major creativity.

It takes a special energy, over and above one’s creative potential, a special audacity or subversiveness, to strike out in a new direction once one is settled

Nor had he allowed himself, as Pinter did, time to forget it, to let it fall into his unconscious, where it might link with other experiences and thoughts.

ime, “forgetting,” and incubation are equally necessary before deep scientific or mathematical insights can be achieved. Henri Poincaré, the great mathematician, recounts in his autobiography how he wrestled with a particularly difficult mathematical problem but, getting nowhere, became deeply frustrated.*4 He decided to take a break by going on a geological excursion, and this travel distracted him from his mathematical problem

It is instead the incubation of hugely complex problems performed by an entire hidden, creative self. Poincaré pays tribute to this unconscious self: it “is not purely automatic; it is capable of discernment;…it knows how to choose, to divine….It knows better how to divine than the conscious self, since it succeeds where that has failed.”

At such times, when I am writing, thoughts seem to organize themselves in spontaneous succession and to clothe themselves instantly in appropriate words. I feel I can bypass or transcend much of my own personality, my neuroses. It is at once not me and the innermost part of me, certainly the best part of me.

when they may lose the sense of visual continuity and motion and see instead a flickering series of “stills.” The stills may be clear-cut and sharp, succeeding one another without superimposition or overlap. But more commonly they are somewhat blurred, as with a too-long photographic exposure; they persist long enough that each is still visible when the next “frame” is seen

She had been stuck, transfixed, at that perceptual moment when there was just an inch of water in the bath.
Such standstills showed that consciousness could be brought to a halt for substantial periods while automatic, nonconscious function—maintenance of posture or breathing, for example—continued as before.

These differences imply that there must be a number of different mechanisms or systems for the perception of visual motion and the continuity of visual consciousness, and this accords with evidence obtained from perceptual and psychological experiments

Even the highest powers of art—whether in film, or theater, or literary narrative—can only convey the faintest intimation of what human consciousness is really like.

The “snapshots” that Crick and Koch postulate are not uniform, like cinematic ones. The duration of successive snapshots, they feel, is not likely to be constant; moreover, the time of a snapshot for shape, say, may not coincide with one for color

Why, out of a thousand possible perceptions, are these the ones I seize upon? Reflections, memories, associations, lie behind them. For consciousness is always active and selective—charged with feelings and meanings uniquely our own, informing our choices and interfusing our perceptions. So it is not just Seventh Avenue that I see but my Seventh Avenue, marked by my own selfhood and identity.

But we deceive ourselves if we imagine that we can ever be passive, impartial observers. Every perception, every scene, is shaped by us, whether we intend it or know it, or not. We are the directors of the film we are making—but we are its subjects too: every frame, every moment, is us, is ours.

Why? One must wonder whether this neglect was not caused by the growing pressures at the beginning of the new century to try to explain scientific phenomena, following a time when it was enough to simply describe them

While we have moved from an era of pure description to one of active investigation and explanation, Tourette’s itself has been fragmented in the process and is no longer seen as a whole.

As used by neurologists, the term “scotoma” (from the Greek for “darkness”) denotes a disconnection or hiatus in perception, essentially a gap in consciousness produced by a neurological lesion. (Such lesions may be at any level, from the peripheral nerves, as in my own case, to the sensory cortex of the brain.) It is extremely difficult for a patient with such a scotoma to be able to communicate what is happening. He himself scotomizes the experience because the affected limb is no longer part of his internal body image. Such a scotoma is literally unimaginable unless one is actually experiencing it. This is why I suggest, only half jocularly, that people read A Leg to Stand On while under spinal anesthesia, so that they will know in their own persons what I am describing

In his paper, “On Unnoticed Sensations and Errors of Judgment,” Köhler wrote of how premature simplifications and systemizations in science, psychology in particular, could ossify science and prevent its vital growth. “Each science,” he wrote, “has a sort of attic into which things are almost automatically pushed that cannot be used at the moment, that do not quite fit….We are constantly putting aside, unused, a wealth of valuable material [that leads to] the blocking of scientific progress.”*9

Scotoma, surprisingly common in all fields of science, involves more than prematurity; it involves a loss of knowledge, a forgetting of insights that once seemed clearly established, and sometimes a regression to less perceptive explanations. What makes an observation or a new idea acceptable, discussable, memorable? What may prevent it from being so, despite its clear importance and value?

It is not enough to apprehend something, to “get” something, in a flash. The mind must be able to accommodate it, to retain it. The first barrier lies in allowing oneself to encounter new ideas, to create a mental space, a category with potential connection—and then to bring these ideas into full and stable consciousness, to give them conceptual form, holding them in mind even if they contradict one’s existing concepts, beliefs, or categories. This process of accommodation, of spaciousness of mind, is crucial in determining whether an idea or discovery will take hold and bear fruit or whether it will be forgotten, fade, and die without issue.

Darwin often remarked that no man could be a good observer unless he was an active theorizer as well

Theory, though, can be a great enemy of honest observation and thought, especially when it hardens into unstated, perhaps unconscious, dogma or assumption.

Undermining one’s existing beliefs and theories can be a very painful, even terrifying, process—painful because our mental lives are sustained, consciously or unconsciously, by theories, sometimes invested with the force of ideology or delusion.

Chance favors the prepared mind,” as Claude Bernard famously wrote
